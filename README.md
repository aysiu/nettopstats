# nettopstats
Accumulates daily outputs of the nettop command

## What does nettopstats do?
It basically runs the `nettop` command every 15 minutes and saves the output to one .json file per day.

## How does nettopstats differ from other projects?
I'd love to be proven wrong, but at least as of the creation of nettopstats, it didn't appear that there were any projects that fit the following criteria:
- Doesn't block traffic by default (act as a firewall), forcing the user to manually approve each process using network traffic.
- Actually keeps track of accumulated traffic per process (instead of just showing the traffic per process in real time).
- Runs on macOS.

## Requirements for nettopstats
- macOS (tested on 10.15 Catalina but will likely work on other versions).
- Python 3.7 (currently points to /usr/bin/python3, but you can change that line to point to whatever location you want... may work on Python 3.8 or higher, too)
- [munkipkg](https://github.com/munki/munki-pkg) (to build the installer package) **If you're not going to use `/usr/bin/python3`, change the path in the `nettopstats` script to wherever your Python 3 is _before_ you build the pkg**

## How resource-intensive is this?
I don't know. This project may be a total failure in terms of resources. I've set it to run every 15 minutes. That's quite often, but it's also just doing a very quick dump of `nettop` output, so it may not be resource-intensive at all.

## How do you use nettopstats?
If you build and install the pkg, it should just run by itself, and then dump out daily .json files to `~/Library/Application Support/nettopstats`.

If you want to analyze the results later, run `/usr/local/bin/nettopstats --analyze daily` or `/usr/local/bin/nettopstats --analyze monthly`.

## How accurate is this tool?
I don't know. When I was sampling every 2, 5, 10, or 15 seconds, it seems the numbers were significantly inflated (hundreds of GB instead of single digits of GB), so I don't know exactly how the sampling for `nettop -L 1` works. Currently trying to run only every 15 minutes or so to see if that's closer to actual usage.

Also, standard Python (you can import special libraries) is annoying with time zones, so the by-day .json log is by whatever the time is in UTC, so you may start seeing data not exactly line up with today or yesterday, but if you just want to know roughly what's using the most bandwidth, it may not matter. Just something to keep in mind.

## What kind of support is there for nettopstats?
Right now? None. This is kind of released as is. If it works for you, great! If it doesn't, I hope you find something else. See a bug you want to fix, make a pull request, and I'll likely review it.
